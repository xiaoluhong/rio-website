  <h2>Why Use Rio</h2>
  <div class="grid-three">
    <div>
    <h5>Built for DevOps</h5>
    <p>Rio installs into any Kubernetes cluster
    and handles all the wiring for common
    services like Istio for service mesh;
    Knative for creating event functions;
    and Prometheus for monitoring.
    With a few simple commands, Rio can
    implement Git-based continuous
    delivery; help optimize routing for your
    apps; give you canary, A/B and
    Blue/Green deployments; monitor
    HTTP traffic inside your service mesh;
    deliver smart autoscaling and more.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h5>Streamline your release pipeline</h5>
    <p>Rio helps you deliver the best possible
    application release experience to your
    users.</p>
    <p>Tell Rio to automatically build and
      deploy new app releases when you
      commit changes to your repo.</p>
    <p>When rolling out new versions of
      your app, Rio understands the
      current load and scales up for
      maximum performance using Layer 4
      and Layer 7 metrics from
      Prometheus.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>Maximum security by default</h5>
      <p>When using Rio, your apps launch with
      the most secure network configuration
      possible.</p>
      <p>Workloads receive a DNS record and
        a wildcard certificate from
        LetsEncrypt.</p>
      <p>Built for multitenancy, Rio also
        integrates with Kubernetes RBAC for
        maximum security.</p>
      <p>Your apps will automatically include
        resource constraints for optimal
        cluster performance.</p>

  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>Rio is a lightweight, cloud-native platform that delivers a fully integrated deployment experience from operations to pipeline without
    taking over the cluster. Easily installed using Rancher’s App Catalog, Rio also runs from the CLI on any Kubernetes cluster
    anywhere, even on your laptop.</p>
